# Sudoku-Solver-Using-CNN
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using TensorFlow to scan any Sudoku puzzle in real-time and overlay its solution onto the image of the Sudoku grid. The overall system is implemented using OpenCV in Python, combining robust image processing with deep learning.
